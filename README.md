Datalog Disassembly
===================

A *fast* disassembler which is *accurate* enough for the resulting
assembly code to be reassembled.  The disassembler implemented using
the datalog ([souffle](https://github.com/souffle-lang/souffle))
declarative logic programming language to compile disassembly rules
and heuristics.  The disassembler first parses ELF file information
and decodes a superset of possible instructions to create an initial
set of datalog facts.  These facts are analyzed to identify *code
location*, *symbolization*, and *function boundaries*.  The results of
this analysis, a refined set of datalog facts, are then translated to
the [GTIRB](https://github.com/grammatech/gtirb) intermediate
representation for binary analysis and reverse engineering.  The
[GTIRB pretty printer](https://github.com/grammatech/gtirb-pprinter)
may then be used to pretty print the GTIRB to reassemblable assembly
code.


## Dependencies

ddisasm uses C++17, and requires a compiler which supports
that standard such as gcc 7, clang 6, or MSVC 2017.

To build and install ddisasm, the following requirements
should be installed:

- [gtirb](https://github.com/grammatech/gtirb)
- [gtirb-pprinter](https://github.com/grammatech/gtirb-pprinter)
- [Capstone](http://www.capstone-engine.org/), version 4.0.1 or later
- [Souffle](https://souffle-lang.github.io), version 1.7.0 or higher
  - Must be configured with support for 64 bit numbers (via `--enable-64bit-domain` during configuration)
- [libehp](https://git.zephyr-software.com/opensrc/libehp), version 1.0.0 or higher
- [LIEF](https://lief.quarkslab.com/), version 0.9.0 or higher
- [libdwarf](https://www.prevanders.net/dwarf.html)

Note that these versions are newer than what your package manager may provide
by default: This is true on Ubuntu 18, Debian 10, and others. Prefer building
these dependencies from sources to avoid versioning problems.

## Building ddisasm
Use the following options to configure cmake:

- You can tell CMake which compiler to use with
  `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<compiler>`.

- Normally CMake will find GTIRB automatically, but if it does not you
  can pass `-Dgtirb_DIR=<path-to-gtirb-build>`.

- ddisasm can make use of GTIRB in static library form (instead of
 shared library form, the default) if you use the flag
 `-DDDISASM_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF`.

Once the dependencies are installed, you can configure and build as
follows:

```
$ cmake ./ -Bbuild
$ cd build
$ make
```
## Building ddisasm inside a Docker image

The directory [.ci](https://github.com/GrammaTech/ddisasm/tree/master/.ci)
contains several Docker files to build ddisasm under different OS and compiler.
These docker files assume that GTIRB, gtirb-pprinter and libehp have been
checked out inside the ddisasm directory.

The steps to build ddisasm inside a ubuntu 16 image using clang are:
```
git clone https://github.com/GrammaTech/ddisasm.git
cd ddisasm
git clone https://github.com/GrammaTech/gtirb.git
git clone https://github.com/GrammaTech/gtirb-pprinter.git
git clone https://git.zephyr-software.com/opensrc/libehp
docker build -f .ci/Dockerfile.ubuntu16-clang -t ddisasm-ubuntu16-clang .
```

## Running the analysis

Once `ddisasm` is built, we can run complete analysis on a file by
calling `build/bin/ddisasm'`.  For example, we can run the analysis on one
of the examples as follows:

```
cd build/bin && ./ddisasm ../../examples/ex1/ex --asm ex.s
```

Ddisasm accepts the following parameters:

`--help`
:   produce help message

`--ir arg`
:   GTIRB output file

`--json arg`
:   GTIRB json output file

`--asm arg`
:   ASM output file

`--debug`
:   if the assembly code is printed, it is printed with debugging information

`--debug-dir arg`
:   location to write CSV files for debugging

`-K [ --keep-functions ] arg`
:   Print the given functions even if they are skipped by default (e.g. _start)

`--self-diagnose`
:   This option is useful for debugging. Use relocation information to emit a self diagnosis
    of the symbolization process. This option only works if the target
    binary contains complete relocation information. You can enable
    that in `ld` using the option `--emit-relocs`.

`-F [ --skip-function-analysis ]`
:   Skip additional analyses to compute more precise function boundaries.

`-j [ --threads ]`
:   Number of cores to use. It is set to the number of cores in the machine by default.

## Rewriting a project

The directory tests/ contains the script `reassemble_and_test.sh` to
rewrite and test a complete project. `reassemble_and_test.sh` rebuilds
a project using the compiler and compiler flags specified in the
enviroment variables CC and CFLAGS (`make -e`), rewrites the binary
and run the project tests on the new binary.

We can rewrite ex1 as follows:

```
cd examples/ex1
make
ddisasm ex --asm ex.s
gcc ex.s -o ex_rewritten
```

## Testing

The directory `tests/` also contains a script `test_small.sh` for
rewriting the examples in `/examples` with different compilers and
optimization flags.
